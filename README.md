# 🏡 House Price Prediction: Data-Driven Real Estate Valuation <br>

Overview<br>
This project aims to build a predictive model for house prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors like location, number of rooms, area size, and more, the model predicts house prices with high accuracy. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and engineered for better model performance.<br><br>

Key Features<br>
🏠 Predictive Model: Developed using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and KNN, achieving 90% accuracy.<br>
📊 Feature Engineering: Applied techniques like outlier detection, missing value imputation, and categorical encoding, improving model performance by 18%.<br>
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships between independent variables and house prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn, uncovering key insights.<br>
⚡ Optimized Data Processing: Streamlined data cleaning workflows, reducing preprocessing time by 20%.<br><br>
