<b>House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Models<b><br>
This repository contains the code and detailed results of my Capstone Project for the MCA degree in Data Science. The goal of this project was to predict house prices using various machine learning models and evaluate their performance based on accuracy, error metrics, and generalization.<br>

Project Overview<br>
In this project, I explored a dataset containing information on house features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, etc., to predict the sale prices of the houses. The project includes the following key steps:<br>
Data Cleaning:<br>
Removed missing values, handled outliers, and dealt with categorical variables.<br><br>

Data Preprocessing:<br>
Normalized and standardized the data for better model performance.<br>
Split the data into training and testing sets for validation.<br><br>

Model Building and Evaluation:<br>
Built multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, and Decision Tree.<br>
Evaluated models based on performance metrics such as RMSE, R² Score, MSE, and Adjusted R².<br>
Fine-tuned hyperparameters to maximize model performance.<br><br>

Model Comparison:<br>
The Random Forest Model performed the best, achieving an R² score of 0.94 and an RMSE of 0.24, making it the best predictor for this dataset.<br><br>

Models Used:<br>
Linear Regression<br>
Random Forest<br>
KNN Regression<br>
Decision Tree<br>
Support Vector Regressor<br>
Gradient Boosting<br>
XGBoost<br>
Bagging Regressor<br><br>

Key Results<br>
Random Forest Model:<br>
Accuracy: 94% (on test data)<br>
RMSE: 0.24<br>
R² Score: 0.94<br>
This model emerged as the best performer, with a strong ability to generalize on unseen data and minimal overfitting.<br>
XGBoost and Support Vector Regressor also showed strong performance, with R² scores around 0.94.<br><br>
